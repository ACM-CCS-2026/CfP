# Request for feedback on the ACM CCS 2026 Draft CfP (via GitHub issues)

We have posted a public draft Call for Papers for ACM CCS 2026 and would greatly value community feedback via GitHub issues before we finalize it:
https://github.com/ACM-CCS-2026/CfP

Our goal is to keep the CfP clear, inclusive, and aligned with current research practice. Your input now will help us converge on the right scope, policies, and timeline.

To provide feedback, open the repository above, click Issues, then New issue. Please use a concise title and, if helpful, begin with a bracketed tag (for example: [track-justification], [ml-guidance], [artifacts], etc). One topic per issue helps keep discussion focused.

Feedback that is especially helpful:
- [track-justification] Is the required Track Justification Statement clear and reasonable?
- [ml-guidance] Is the ML placement guidance and threat-model requirement calibrated appropriately?
- [artifacts] Are artifact expectations and the optional AE setup appropriate for our community?

If possible, please comment within the next two weeks (by November 12, 2025) so we can incorporate changes and publish the final CfP promptly.

If GitHub is not convenient, you may email the Program Co-Chairs at ccs26-pc-chairs@acm.org
(GitHub is preferred so discussions are transparent to all).

Thank you for helping us shape a clear and community-aligned CfP. We look forward to your suggestions.
